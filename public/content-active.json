    "I’m Hank — a design technologist who builds playful interactive experiences.",
    "Most recently I've been focused on emergent digital spaces: from AR tools for healthcare to XR, haptics, and AI at Meta Reality Labs.",
    "I thrive where code, hardware, and imagination meet: turning early ideas into prototypes that can be felt, heard, seen, and (sometimes) smelled. Not tasted though, at least… not yet 🤔",
    "Outside of work, I’m a hobbyist maker with skills in electronics and 3D printing. My love languages are threaded inserts and programmable LEDs.",
    "I also enjoy teaching others how to bring their own interactive ideas to life — whether that’s wiring a first circuit or helping shape a full installation."
